0. Data Prepration
    sketches: more detailed classification
    images: object in pic
            color vector 

    videos: segment into shots
            color vector for every frame in shots
            motion of the shots
            object in the shots
    We need to carefully pick and label these data


[Done]1. draw a sketch  

[Done]2. draw a background

3. perform search
    [Done]* sketch : recognize it, turn it into a tag,
               use tag to filter
    * color: use signature to rank pictures
            - backends need more modification
    * motion: 9 different directions, add another tag to video
            - camera motion and object motion
            - need to manually label videos
            - auto motion detection should be done [[TZ]]

4. revise a search
    [Done]* drag thumbnails to canvas for further editing.
         - all old drawings dropped, new picture as the background
         - size of image changed, fit in the bounding box of size(canvas)

    * When it is a video, extract a certain frame and put it on canvas
         - backend support
    * '+' selector
         - videos are segmented into shots, if '+' is hitted on shot S_1, then all shots from the video V_1 which contains S_1 should be put
           in higher position in the result lise. [Another API]
         
5. show results
    * right hand side, a list of similar videos
        - should have thumbnails
        - should be able to play there
        - separate UI for image and video representation
        - dynamically loading, if loading needs too much time
        - pagination
        - video descriptions (UI issue)

        Matching: precise match for a frame > threshold then put it in the very front, otherwise not

6. User Study
    find someone write some comments
    record their experiment

7. Evaluation
